# 🚀 Python Mini Challenges — Beginner to AI App Developer (1 Day Sprint)

👋 **Hi LinkedIn fam!**
Today I completed a series of small Python challenges to boost my programming skills, starting from basic syntax to deploying a real AI-powered web app. Sharing this to inspire fellow learners — feel free to try them too! 💡

---

## 🏆 **Challenge List:**

### 1️⃣ **Basic Python Functions**

* Print greetings for multiple users (Hello, Paras / Nayan)
* Write a function to sum numbers (Sum = 12)
* Check if a number is even or odd using boolean logic (Is 4 even? True)

### 2️⃣ **Pandas Data Manipulation** 📊

* Create a DataFrame of students with Name, Age, Score
* Display shape, column names, datatypes, and summary statistics
* Filter data (people with age > 21)
* Calculate average score (89.82)

### 3️⃣ **NumPy Array Operations** 🔢

* Add 5 to all elements in an array
* Square all elements in an array
* Create a matrix and compute:

  * Transpose
  * Multiply matrix by scalar (2)

### 4️⃣ **Machine Learning with scikit-learn** 🤖

* Train a classifier on **Iris dataset**
* Check feature/target shape and model accuracy (100%)
* Predict sample class (setosa)

### 5️⃣ **Streamlit AI Web App Development** 🌐

* Build an interactive **Iris Flower Classifier** web app
* Include sliders for sepal/petal length & width
* Predict and display flower class (versicolor)
